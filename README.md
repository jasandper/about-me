# My Portfolio

I've created three HTML pages to make up my portfolio web application.  The nav bar on each page links to an "About Me" , "Contact", and "Portfolio" page. 

The about me page includes a header, and image of myself and a paragraph all inside a container. 

The contact page includes a bootstrap form layout to gather "name", "email", and a "message".  

The portfolio page containes photo placeholders for future portfolio projects.
